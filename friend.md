I am currently pursuing my master degree in School of Remote Sensing and Information Engineering, Wuhan University, under the supervision of Prof. <a href="http://jszy.whu.edu.cn/liyansheng/zh_CN/index.htm">Yansheng Li</a>. Before that, I have received my bachelor degree in Software Engineering in School of Computer Science and Technology, Anhui University, Hefei, China. At present, my research interests include computer vision (Especially in Generative Adversarial models & Semantic Segmentation) and machine learning.
